            <h1> Project Goal: </h1>
            <strong>
                <thread>The goal of this project is to examine and visualize the relationship between 
                    movie genre and soundtrack.  More specifically, we wanted to create 
                    meaningful visualizations that allow the viewer to easily observe relationships 
                    and trends between movie genre and song selection.  Furthermore, we wanted to create 
                    easy to use but effective visualizations that allow the user to filter and choose
                    what data they can see as well as interact with.

                    Each visualization has an intended use, and are best utilized when 
                    paired with the other visualizations on this site as well.  For example,
                    the best way for a user who is curious about how the soundtracks in 
                    horror movies differed from the soundtracks in comedy movies, then the user 
                    would click on the cell in the matrix that corresponded to the horror and 
                    comedy genres.  When using this matrix, it is important to be aware that the
                    darker green a cell is, the more the difference is noticable for the two 
                    movie genres that cell is associated with.  The radar, to the left, will then 
                    show the user which specific attributes the soundtracks had differences in, and then 
                    by how much.  For example, the soundtracks for comedy movies had an accoustic 
                    value of 0.3, whereas the soundtracks for horror movies only had an accoustic value
                    of 0.2, meaning the average difference for how accoustic the soundtracks of 
                    horror movies and comedy movies was only a value of 0.1.  Then, the user can select 
                    these genres from the scatterplot, as well as the corresponding attributes, and see
                    how the scatterplot visualoizes this for the soundtrack of each comedy and horror movie
                    in the dataset.
